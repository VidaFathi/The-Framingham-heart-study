# The-Framingham-heart-study

In this study, we want to predict a 10-year risk of CHD(Coronary Heart Disease). 
CHD has been the leading cause of death worldwide since 1921, but since 1950( after the Framingham study), age-adjusted death rates have declined 60%.
CHD is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart. To predict CHD, we need to evaluate risk factors (which is our independent variable). 
These risk factors help us to identify important risk factors for having a successful prediction of CHD. 

What are Risk Factors? 
  Risk Factors are the variables that increase the chances of a disease.

I built a model in R  using the Framingham data  in a CSV file to predict and prevent heart disease.

hypothesized CHD risk factors that collected for the study:
1. male
2. age
3. education: some high school(1)/ high school/GED(2)/ some college/vocational school(3)/College(4)
4. currentSmoker (0,1),cigsPerDay
5. BPmeds
6. prevalentStroke
7. PrevalentHyp
8. diabetes
9. ....


at the end we want to predict 'TenYearCHD'
